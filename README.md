# DCS Scratchpad

Resizable and movable DCS World ingame Scratchpad for quick notes - especially useful in VR.

## Installation

Copy the `Scripts` folder into your DCS Saved games folder.

## Usage

- Toggle scratchpad with `CTRL+Shift+X`. The shortcut can be changed in your DCS saved games folder under `Config/ScratchpadConfig.lua` (if the file does not exist, start DCS once after mod installation).
- Use `Esc` to remove the textfield focus, but keep the scratchpad open.
